### injector is not working? check this first (V2.5 and lower)
* the core is still in the bin folder
if the core is not in the bin folder or the bin folder does not exist at all then you will get this error

* hades.dll is in the bin folder
if the dll is not in the bin folder, the Injector cannot do anything an easy way to see if the dll is installed is in the settings tab
